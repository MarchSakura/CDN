Based on [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN, which is a free CDN for Open Source.

The CDN repo is for managing my config files and image hosting.

!! There is an incalculable delay in updating file content by jsDelivr 

# example 

To get the configure file in folder ```config_file```:

```bash
wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarchSakura/CDN/config_file/tmux.conf -O ~/.tmux.conf
```
